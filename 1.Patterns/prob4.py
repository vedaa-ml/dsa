# Problem Description:

# You are given an integer n. Your task is to return a right-angled triangle pattern of '*' where each side has n characters, represented as a list of strings. The triangle has '*' characters, starting with 1 star in the first row, 2 stars in the second row, and so on until the last row has n stars.



# Input Parameters:

# n (int): The height and base of the right-angled triangle.



# Output:

# A list of strings where each string is a row of '*' characters that increases in length from 1 to n.



# Example:

# Input: 3
# Output: ['*', '**', '***']
 
# Input: 5
# Output: ['*', '**', '***', '****', '*****']
