# Problem Description:

# You are given two integers, n and m. Your task is to return a rectangle pattern of '*',
# where n represents the number of rows (length) and m represents the number of columns (breadth).


# Input:Two integers n and m, where 1 <= n, m <= 100.

# Output:  A list of strings where each string represents a row of the rectangle pattern.

# Input: n = 4, m = 5
# Output: ['*****', '*****', '*****', '*****']
 
# Input: n = 3, m = 2
# Output: ['**', '**', '**']

def generate_rectangle(n, m):
    
    # Your code here
    l = []
    for i in range(n):
        l.append("*"*m)
    return l
